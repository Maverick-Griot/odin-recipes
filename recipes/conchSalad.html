    <h3>Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Skin, clean and tenderize the pound of conch flesh. Cut the tenderized conch into cubes and strips</li>
            <li>Move conch meat to a bowl and cover with lemon juice. Rest in fridge for atleast an hour.</li>
            <li>Dice green pepper, and tomatoes into chewable chunks. Place into a large bowl that has a lid.</li>
            <li>Finely dice the half of sweet onion and jalopeños. <i>I recommend a food processor for this</i>. Place in the same bowl as the green peppers and tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated conch meat to the bowl of diced veggies. Mix it all up.</li>
            <li>Squeeze as much juice as you can from the blood orange over the veggies and conch in the bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour the remaining water, lime, vinegar, and 1/4 of the lemon juice from the marinate into the bowl. Give it a nice stir to mix everything together.</li>
            <li>Add Pepper, Adobe seasoning to taste. Salt can be used as well just be aware Adobe contains salt already so dont be afraid to give it a taste first.</li>
            <li>If you want a bit of kick add some scotch bonnet to the dish. Less is more here.</li>
            <li>Allow to rest in the fridge for atleast a few hours. The longer it sits the better it will taste.</li>
        </ol>
